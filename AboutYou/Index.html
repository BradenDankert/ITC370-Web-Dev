    <h1>This is a page about me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Braden Dankert I am a senior with this being my last semester at MSU. I have two brothers one being my twin but we do not look alike.
        A couple things I like are dogs which I have three. I also like to travel I have been to four other countries outside the US. 
        I am a big sports fan mostly basketball with my favorite collegeteam being Kentucky and my favorite NBA team being the Lakers.
        I look forward to my last semester here at MSU and finishing school.</p>
